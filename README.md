# glih: blih, but in go

glih is a golang version of the BLIH script, which can be found here (v1: https://github.com/kayofeld/script-installation-ordinateur-epitech/blob/master/installation/.files/blih, v2: https://github.com/bocal/blih).

While there may not be a huge need for such a program (the current python script functionning properly), it exists for a few reasons:

- Golang is (slightly) faster than python
- It is a cleaner version of blih (unused and useless options such as --version were removed and missing informations were added to the usage)
- It may be a good learning tool for students interested by go

Granted, those reasons are not enough to convince anyone in their right mind to switch from the orginal script to glih. To be fair, it is only a step towards a greater goal; I just slightly diverted from my tracks to create this (why? Because I could!).
